# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Project Overview

Pewlett-Hackard’s Human Resources department is developing a transition plan that encompasses retirement packages for soon to be retirees and a mentorship program to train other employees on taking those new vacant positions, in order o avoid the negative effects of a “silver-tsunami”. Before they start drafting the plan, the HR team needs an analysis of the number of people retiring, their titles, and names, and a list of employees who could participate in the mentorship program. Our analysis results provide answers to the following:
Who will be retiring in the next few years? 
Who is eligible to participate in the mentorship program?

## Results

* There are 72,458 employees retiring soon. The complete list of retirement-age employees by most recent job title can be found in the [unique_titles.csv]() file.

* The chart below provides further details on the number of retirement-age employees grouped by functional title.

 * There are 1,549 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program. The complete list of eligible employees can be found in the [mentorship_elegibility.csv]() file.

## Summary

There is a large number of employees in retirement-age, PH should promptly finish putting together its retirement package and start discussing it with those employees who plan to leave the soonest. 

PH should immediately launch the mentorship program for those positions that will be vacant the soonest and hiring new employees who would be included in the mentorship program as well. The hiring piece is crucial, as there aren't enough employees who qualify for the mentorship program.

The number of retirement-age employees is significantly higher than those who are available for the mentorship program. This means PH may have to hire multiple positions simultaneously. The HR team might need help filling up these positions so the company should consider retaining a recruiting firm to help with high volume hiring.
