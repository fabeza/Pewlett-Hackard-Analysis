# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Project Overview

Pewlett-Hackard’s Human Resources department is developing a transition plan that encompasses retirement packages for soon to be retirees and a mentorship program to train other employees on taking those new vacant positions, in order o avoid the negative effects of a “silver-tsunami”. Before they start drafting the plan, the HR team needs an analysis of the number of people retiring, their titles, and names, and a list of employees who could participate in the mentorship program. Our analysis results provide answers to the following:
Who will be retiring in the next few years? 
Who is eligible to participate in the mentorship program?

## Results

* In the file [retirement_titles.csv](https://github.com/fabeza/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/9a7b1e6eca4bbd7305db6da7fdf54f09e15dbaf8/Data/retirement_titles.csv) we can see a full list of retirement-age employees and the titles they have previously held at PH. Please note there are duplicate entries for some employees because they have switched titles over the years. In the next bullet you'll find a list of only the most recent title of each retirement-age employee. 

* There are 72,458 employees retiring soon. The complete list of retirement-age employees by most recent job title can be found in the [unique_titles.csv](https://github.com/fabeza/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/471444de8d9db845bb243a2a189eab4ee8cd0f2b/Data/unique_titles.csv) file.

* The chart below provides further details on the number of retirement-age employees grouped by functional title. The majority of retirement-age employees are at the senior engineer and senior staff levels.

 * There are 1,549 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program. The complete list of eligible employees can be found in the [mentorship_elegibility.csv](https://github.com/fabeza/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/471444de8d9db845bb243a2a189eab4ee8cd0f2b/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv) file.

## Summary

There is a large number of employees in retirement-age, PH should promptly finish putting together its retirement package and start discussing it with those employees who plan to leave the soonest. 

PH should immediately launch the mentorship program for those positions that will be vacant the soonest and hiring new employees who would be included in the mentorship program as well. The hiring piece is crucial, as shown in the results below, there are only 1,549 employees who qualify for the mentorship program and 72,458 close to retiring, most of them, at the senior engineer level.

Eligible for mentorship:

Close to retiring:

The number of retirement-age employees is significantly higher than those who are available for the mentorship program. This means PH may have to hire multiple positions simultaneously. The HR team might need help filling up these positions so the company should consider retaining a recruiting firm to help with high volume hiring.
